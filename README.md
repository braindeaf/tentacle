# Tentacles
I've used multiple Rails Admin gems / engines and none of them quite work for me. This is a stab at a new one, taking inspiration from the others that works for me.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tentacles'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install tentacles
```
